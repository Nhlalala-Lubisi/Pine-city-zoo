                <h3>PANDAS</h3>
                <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a bear species native to the mountain forests of central
                    China. Known for its distinctive black-and-white coat and gentle demeanor, the panda has become a
                    global symbol of wildlife conservation.</p>

                <p>Pandas are classified as carnivores, but their diet is over 99% bamboo. They spend up to 14 hours a
                    day eating, using their strong jaws and pseudo-thumbs to grasp and chew bamboo stalks. Occasionally,
                    they may eat other plants or even small animals.</p>

                <p>Giant pandas are solitary and spend most of their time alone. They have a highly developed sense of
                    smell that allows them to avoid other individuals and locate potential mates. Pandas are currently
                    classified as vulnerable, with habitat loss and low reproduction rates being their main threats.</p>

                    <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p>
                </strong>
                <p>You will find the pandas at pen F03, within the Asian Forest Exhibit near the bamboo gardens.</p>
