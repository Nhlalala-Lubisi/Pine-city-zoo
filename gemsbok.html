                <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                <p>The gemsbok (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope native to arid regions of Southern Africa, such as
                    the Kalahari Desert. It is known for its striking appearance, with long, straight horns and bold
                    black-and-white facial markings. Gemsbok are part of the Oryx genus, which also includes other
                    desert-dwelling antelope species.</p>
                <p>They are well-adapted to dry conditions, capable of going without water for extended periods by
                    extracting moisture from the plants they eat. Their light-colored coats reflect sunlight, and
                    they are most active during cooler parts of the day.</p>
                <p>Both males and females have horns, which can grow up to 85 cm (33 in) long and are used for
                    defense against predators and during fights for dominance. Their strong build and horns help them
                    deter threats such as lions and hyenas.</p>
                <strong>
                    <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p>
                </strong>
