                <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                <p>The giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest
                    ruminant on Earth. Native to Africa, giraffes are easily recognized by their extremely long necks
                    and legs, unique coat patterns, and ossiconesâ€”horn-like structures on their heads.</p>
                <p>Adult males can reach heights of up to 5.5 meters (18 feet), while females are slightly shorter.
                    Their long necks allow them to feed on leaves, fruits, and flowers from tall trees, especially
                    acacias, which are inaccessible to most other herbivores.</p>
                <p>Giraffes are social animals, often found in loose groups without a strong social bond. Despite their
                    size, they can run at speeds of up to 60 km/h (37 mph) for short distances. Their height gives them
                    excellent visibility to spot predators like lions from afar.</p>
                <strong>
                    <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p>
                </strong>
                <p>You will find the giraffes at pen C05, near the tall savannah observation deck.</p>
