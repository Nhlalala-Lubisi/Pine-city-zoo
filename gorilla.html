                <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                <p>Gorillas are the largest living primates and are native to the forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa.
                    There are two species: the eastern gorilla (Gorilla beringei) and the western gorilla (Gorilla
                    gorilla), each with two subspecies. Gorillas share 98â€“99% of their DNA with humans, making them one
                    of our closest relatives in the animal kingdom.</p>

                <p>They are known for their muscular build, broad chests, and gentle nature. Gorillas live in groups
                    called troops or bands led by a dominant male known as a silverback, named for the distinctive
                    silver hair on his back. They primarily eat leaves, fruit, stems, and bamboo shoots.</p>

                <p>Despite their powerful appearance, gorillas are shy and peaceful animals. They communicate through
                    vocalizations, body postures, and facial expressions. Sadly, gorillas are endangered due to habitat
                    loss, poaching, and diseases.</p>

                <strong>
                    <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p>
                </strong>
                <p>You will find the gorillas at pen G11, in the rainforest primate section of the zoo.</p>
