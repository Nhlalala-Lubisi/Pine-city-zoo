                <h3>KOALA</h3>
                <p>The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) is a tree-dwelling marsupial native to Australia, recognized for
                    its fluffy ears, spoon-shaped nose, and gentle expression. Often called a "koala bear" (incorrectly,
                    as they are not bears), koalas are one of Australia's most iconic animals.</p>

                <p>Koalas feed almost exclusively on eucalyptus leaves, which are low in nutrients and toxic to most
                    animals. To cope with this diet, koalas have a specialized digestive system and sleep up to 18â€“22
                    hours a day to conserve energy. Their strong limbs and sharp claws make them excellent climbers.</p>

                <p>Koalas are generally solitary and communicate using loud bellows, especially during mating season.
                    Habitat destruction, bushfires, and disease (such as chlamydia) are major threats to their survival
                    in the wild.</p>

                <strong>
                    <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p>
                </strong>
                <p>You will find the koalas at pen A09, inside the eucalyptus grove in the Australian Animals section.
