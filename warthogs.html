                <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
                <p>Warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus) are wild members of the pig family native to Africa. Known for
                    their large curved tusks, wart-like facial bumps, and sparse body hair, warthogs are surprisingly
                    fast and intelligent animals that thrive in savannahs, grasslands, and woodlands.</p>

                <p>They use their tusks for defense and digging, and often kneel on their front knees while feeding on
                    grasses, roots, and bulbs. Despite their tough appearance, warthogs are primarily herbivores but
                    will scavenge if the opportunity arises.</p>

                <p>Warthogs are social creatures, typically seen in small groups called sounders, which consist of
                    females and their young. Males are more solitary. When threatened, warthogs run with their tails
                    held upright as a warning signal for others.</p>

                    <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p>
                </strong>
                <p>You will find the warthogs at pen W07, near the Savannah Plains exhibit entrance.</p>
