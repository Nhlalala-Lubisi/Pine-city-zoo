                <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
                <p>Monkeys are highly intelligent primates found in various regions around the world, including Africa,
                    Asia, Central and South America. There are two major types of monkeys: Old World monkeys, which live
                    in Africa and Asia, and New World monkeys, found in the Americas.</p>

                <p>Monkeys are known for their agility, expressive faces, and advanced problem-solving abilities. They
                    are social animals that live in groups and communicate through vocalizations, facial expressions,
                    and body movements. Their diets vary widely, including fruits, leaves, insects, and even small
                    animals.</p>

                <p>Some species have prehensile tails that help them grasp branches, especially among New World monkeys
                    like spider monkeys. Monkeys are active and playful, making them one of the most engaging species to
                    observe at the zoo.</p>

                <strong>
                    <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p>
                </strong>
                <p>You will find the monkeys at pen M14, inside the Tropical Primate Zone near the treetop walkway.</p>
