                <h3>LIONS</h3>
                <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large carnivorous feline native to Africa and a small region in India.
                    Known as the "king of the jungle," lions are famous for their majestic appearance and powerful
                    presence. They are social animals, living in groups called prides, which typically consist of
                    related females, their offspring, and a few adult males.</p>

                <p>Male lions are known for their thick manes, which vary in color and can indicate age, genetics, and
                    testosterone levels. Females do most of the hunting, working cooperatively to catch prey such as
                    zebras, wildebeests, and antelopes. Males protect the pride and its territory.</p>

                <p>Lions can weigh up to 225 kg (500 lb) and grow to lengths of over 2.5 meters (8 feet) excluding the
                    tail. They are most active at night and rest during the day, often lounging in the shade or on high
                    vantage points.</p>

                <strong>
